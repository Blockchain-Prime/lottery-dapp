Probability gaming differs from skill-based games such as sports betting. Statistical tactics for probability gaming can, of course, be applied. However, the foundation of games at Randomly, unless otherwise announced/described, are based on probability using a Random Number Generator (RNG) that takes no 'soft' variables or skill into account but rather base numbers, games purchased, the spread of numbers, spread of games, on a mathematical level. User skill does not apply to the outcome apart from the aforementioned statistical tactic. Probability is based upon statistics and patterns, and statistics can have various outcomes. All output from the Random Number Generator is at any time based upon mathematical probability.`}),e("p",{children:"The settings for gaming return (winnings/customer return) are set via numerical data which the system via the Random Number Generator will over a period of time converge towards. This is best explained by comparing it to the flipping of a coin. Heads and Tails have the same probability/likelihood of appearing for each flip. During a lower series of flips, there is a greater possibility of not getting an equal number of Heads as Tails. The probability of getting an equal number of Heads as Tails increases with the number of flips. In gaming using probability and Random Number Generators, payback (winnings/customer return), where, for example, a payback of 80% will be converged towards the more times a game has run, just as with the flipping of a coin as described above."}),e("p",{children:"Customers understand that probability is random and that they may:"}),i("ul",{children:[e("li",{children:"Not win at all."}),e("li",{children:"Win less than the probability set by Randomly."})]}),e("p",{children:"Customers play at Randomly at their own risk for all considerable aspects."}),e("h2",{children:"Interpreting Game Wins"}),e("p",{children:"Randomly uses a certified Random Number Generator and will hence be able to payout the percentage stated per game in a fair and unbiased manner."}),e("h2",{children:"Modification of Terms"}),e("p",{children:"The organizers reserve the right to modify or update these terms and conditions at any time without prior notice.
